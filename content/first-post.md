A few months ago I began to delve deep into the land of the personal web. My first attempt at this was 
the amazing but complicated and weird static site generator called jekyll. Jekyll is great if you like your blog to look boring
and load slowly however why would you want that? So as I was mucking around [youtube](https://youtube.com/@finndolf) as one does, I
found the solution to my problems staring at me from none other than fireship. I see this video: Hugo in 100 seconds. I watch it,
and I immediatley go to their website, download it. Fire up git bash and begin hacking away. To be honest I am impacient and decided to 
just use any old theme that I found on the Hugo official website. But if you are a person who cares- and is reading this; I do plan
to upgrade this site in the future with my own theme that is just as garish.
